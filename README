League of Legends is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (moba) video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Released on October
2009, League of Legends has become one of the most popular online game in the world. I am a big fan of League of Legends and I have been played League for more than 5 years.
I wonder whether I could predict the results of each ranked games given the teams before the game start?

Based on the thousands of ranked games data, I want to train a model which could predict the winner of each game given each team with a more than 60% accuracy. This is actually a binary classication
problem. Thus, the accuracy of the random guess will be close to 50% if the distribution of two classes is close to 50%.

Raw data is stored in data directory. Raw data is download from: https://www.kaggle.com/paololol/league-of-legends-ranked-matches.

Data Pre-process:
Run data_process_1.py, data_process_2.py, data_process_3.py files one by one and you will get several csv files. There is a file called final_data.csv, which is the data we will use for classification. Some codes in data_process_1.py and data_process_2.py files are from the open source code from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/laowingkin/lol-how-to-win-the-world-championship).

Classification:
Run main.py file and you will see the results of the classification. This file is the main file for the project.
